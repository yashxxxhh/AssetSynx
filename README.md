Assetsynx is a React-based personal portfolio management application that helps users track and manage their financial assets. Currently, the app uses local storage to store and retrieve user data such as login credentials and asset entries, providing a simple demo-like experience without a live backend database. It features a responsive dashboard with charts to visualize assets, a portfolio page to add and manage different asset types (like stocks, crypto, or savings), and secure route protection through local storageâ€“based session handling. The clean UI is built with React and Tailwind CSS, offering a modern and intuitive user interface while serving as a foundational prototype for more advanced financial tracking systems in the future.
